    "text": "At NASA en Español, we’re always exploring new ways to connect with our audiences—especially those who might not see themselves reflected in traditional science communication. This past Valentine’s Day, we launched a mini social media campaign with a simple goal: speak the audience’s shared language while sparking curiosity about space.\nPlaying off a popular trend where brands share themed Valentine’s cards, we created a series of space-inspired Valentines to share across X, Instagram, and Facebook. Each card paired a clever phrase with a space or science fact—designed to feel timely, playful, and most importantly, familiar.\nWhy? Because reaching wider audiences—especially Spanish-speaking communities—requires more than translation. It takes cultural fluency. It means showing up in the spaces where people already are, and speaking in ways that resonate emotionally and culturally.\nThe response exceeded our expectations:\nOver 1 million accounts reached\nMore than 9,400 shares\nNearly 1,200 new followers, with Instagram leading the engagement\nThis campaign reminded us that relatability and relevance are key to accessibility. When we blend science with humor, creativity, and a bit of corazón, we open doors to new audiences—and build lasting connections along the way.\n\n:::"
