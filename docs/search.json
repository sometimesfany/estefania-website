    "section": "",
    "text": "During the 2024 presidential election, NPR took an innovative, visual-first approach to live coverage — combining live-blog, host-led video updates, and shareable visual content optimized for social media. On Election Day (Nov. 5–6), I led the team for Instagram cards curating 25 real-time update cards, spotlighting key state races, Senate and House results, and historic wins. We also posted two brief videos featuring licensed wire footage of each candidate.\nA key part of our strategy was prioritizing sharable Instagram cards—designed to make election updates faster to consume, easier to share, and more impactful. These cards positioned NPR as a go-to source for the information that mattered most to our audience, reinforcing trust through clarity, timeliness, and relevance.\nThe results:\n• 1.1M+ interactions\n• 5% average engagement rate for the entire coverage. The posts that were shared the most were these three:\nMissouri abortion amendment\nAlsobrooks wins Senate seat in Maryland\nHarris conceded the election\n• Nearly 20 million users reached over two days.\nAs part of the campaign, we also published several carousels using the same brand identity, focused on topics we knew would resonate with our audience. These two stories served as a lead-up to our election coverage, helping to establish a consistent visual language so viewers could easily recognize that it was all part of the same editorial effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis campaign demonstrated the power of mixing timeliness and visual storytelling to engage audiences in a fast-paced, high-stakes environment—helping NPR connect meaningfully with millions during a pivotal moment in democracy.\n\n:::"

    "text": "At NASA en Español, we’re always exploring new ways to connect with our audiences—especially those who might not see themselves reflected in traditional science communication. This past Valentine’s Day, we launched a mini social media campaign with a simple goal: speak the audience’s shared language while sparking curiosity about space.\nPlaying off a popular trend where brands share themed Valentine’s cards, we created a series of space-inspired Valentines to share across X, Instagram, and Facebook. Each card paired a clever phrase with a space or science fact—designed to feel timely, playful, and most importantly, familiar.\nWhy? Because reaching wider audiences—especially Spanish-speaking communities—requires more than translation. It takes cultural fluency. It means showing up in the spaces where people already are, and speaking in ways that resonate emotionally and culturally.\nHere are the results:\n• Over 1 million users reached\n• More than 9,400 shares\n• Nearly 1,200 new followers, with Instagram leading the engagement\nThis campaign reminded us that relatability and relevance are key to accessibility. When we blend science with humor, creativity, and a bit of corazón, we open doors to new audiences—and build lasting connections along the way.\n\n:::"

    "text": "Skywatching is inherently communal — people love to share awe-inspiring celestial moments, and a lunar eclipse presents the perfect opportunity to turn that shared wonder into engagement.\nTen days before the eclipse, we launched a coordinated campaign encouraging audiences to invite others to watch the event. By building anticipation early and layering in reminders, Stories, and carousels, we kept our audience engaged throughout. Once we identified momentum, we released a short-form video explainer that broke down what a lunar eclipse is — tapping into rising search interest just ahead of the big night.\nThe results:\n• 10 multimedia posts across Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and X\n• 3M+ users reached\n• 170,000 + total interactions\n• 24,000 + new followers, making it one of our most effective follow-driving efforts\n• Highest engagement came from Instagram, with a carousel achieving a 15% engagement rate\nMost reach came from Facebook, showcasing the importance of platform-specific strategy. On Facebook, the approach was to share location and times, in the form of sharable images.\nThis campaign demonstrated how timing, relevance, and audience-first storytelling can turn a natural event into a powerful opportunity for education and community-building. By releasing the explainer the day before the eclipse, we maximized both SEO value and audience curiosity at the exact moment they were looking for answers.\n\n:::"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Using Video to Drive Deep Engagement on Instagram\nWhen I joined El Diario New York as a Local News Fellow, I noticed a storytelling gap in how we reached our audience on Instagram. Inspired by Telemundo’s consistent use of video, I ramped up our visual storytelling—specifically through IGTV and in-feed videos—to better connect with Latino audiences in a more personal and informative way.\nIn my first month, I increased the number of video posts by 40x compared to the previous month. As a result, views jumped 18x, and we saw a notable shift in how our audience engaged with our content.\nFor example, a video I created about Vanessa Guillén’s disappearance generated 5x more shares and 2.5x more saves than a static post covering the same topic. I realized that video allowed me to pack more context, tone, and emotion into a post—filling in gaps that a single image or short caption couldn’t carry on its own.\nTo build on that momentum, I launched El Diario Chats, an Instagram Live series featuring Latino-owned businesses discussing how COVID-19 impacted them. These stories weren’t just informative—they created a space for the community to feel seen and heard.\n\n:::"

    "section": "",
    "text": "When people talk about “engagement,” they usually mean likes and comments. But for me, saves and shares became the key metrics—because they signal when content truly resonates. They show that a post was meaningful enough for someone to hold onto or pass along.\nFor U.S. Latino audiences, content must feel intentional and authentic. It’s not just about translating—it’s about cultural fluency. Every decision—from visual tone to audio choices to phrasing is rooted in a desire to help our audience feel seen, reflected, and respected.\nHere’s the three things I keep in mind when thinking about driving engagement:\nDigestible content: Breaking complex issues into short, clear videos or visual explainers that were easy to consume—and easy to share. What are the online conversations saying? How can we tap into those conversations to signal we listen as a brand.\nClear calls to action: Invite the audience to engage with you: “share this with someone who needs to see it” or “save this for later.” Or simply asking questions like “Did you know this?”\nTag, collaborate, and engage: I regularly tag organizations and creators doing similar work, which encouraged discovery, collaboration, and broader community engagement.\n:::"

    "text": "For NASA en Español, accessibility in science communication isn’t just about language—it’s about format, delivery, and creating moments that help people feel part of something bigger. When it came time to share key findings from the OSIRIS-REx mission to Asteroid Bennu, we knew we had to go beyond just a press release.\nWe launched a multimedia mini-campaign designed to break down the mission’s results across formats and platforms where our audience is most active. Across Instagram, X, Facebook, and YouTube, we published 11 posts ranging from short-form videos, GIFs, and images to repurposed interviews and Stories.\nThis collaboration included astrochemist Dr. José Aponte to translate technical discoveries into public-friendly messaging. Working closely with NASA’s Spanish-language public affairs lead and video producer —who managed live media interviews I ensured our content was consistent across all formats.\nI tailored the talking points for social platforms, edited, and fact-checked a vertical video explainer for vertical platforms. A shorter version of the video was also created for Stories, summarizing key findings and linking to NASA’s science site for deeper learning.\nWatch the video here.\nTranscript in English.\nThe results:\n• Over 400,000 users reached\n• Instagram led the way, with a single reel reaching over 100,00 users\nThis campaign served as a model for how we can translate complex science into digital-first formats, tapping into the curiosity of the public through visuals, voice, and cross-platform storytelling. By rethinking how we package mission updates, we’re making space exploration feel personal, understandable, and shareable.\n\n:::"
