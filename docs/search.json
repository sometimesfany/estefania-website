    "section": "",
    "text": "During the 2024 presidential election, NPR took an innovative, visual-first approach to live coverage — combining live-blog imagery, host-led video updates, and shareable visual content optimized for social media. On Election Day (Nov. 5–6), I led the team for Instagram cards establishing and curating 25 real-time update cards, spotlighting key state races, Senate and House results, and historic wins. We also posted two brief videos featuring licensed wire footage of each candidate.\nA key part of our strategy was prioritizing sharable Instagram cards—designed to make election updates faster to consume, easier to share, and more impactful. These cards positioned NPR as a go-to source for the information that mattered most to our audience, reinforcing trust through clarity, timeliness, and relevance.\nThe results:\n• 1.1M+ interactions\n• 5% average engagement rate for the entire coverage. The posts that were shared the most were these three:\nMissouri abortion amendment\nAlsobrooks wins Senate seat in Maryland\nHarris conceded the election\n• Nearly 20 million users reached over two days.\nAs part of the campaign, we also published several carousels using the same brand identity, focused on topics we knew would resonate with our audience. These two stories served as a lead-up to our election coverage, helping to establish a consistent visual language so viewers could easily recognize that it was all part of the same editorial effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis campaign demonstrated the power of mixing timeliness and visual storytelling to engage audiences in a fast-paced, high-stakes environment—helping NPR connect meaningfully with millions during a pivotal moment in democracy.\n\n:::"

    "title": "A Valentine’s Day Campaign with Heart (and Science)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "At NASA en Español, we’re always exploring new ways to connect with our audiences—especially those who might not see themselves reflected in traditional science communication. This past Valentine’s Day, we launched a mini social media campaign with a simple goal: speak the audience’s shared language while sparking curiosity about space.\nPlaying off a popular trend where brands share themed Valentine’s cards, we created a series of space-inspired Valentines to share across X, Instagram, and Facebook. Each card paired a clever phrase with a space or science fact—designed to feel timely, playful, and most importantly, familiar.\nWhy? Because reaching wider audiences—especially Spanish-speaking communities—requires more than translation. It takes cultural fluency. It means showing up in the spaces where people already are, and speaking in ways that resonate emotionally and culturally.\nHere are the results:\n• Over 1 million users reached\n• More than 9,400 shares\n• Nearly 1,200 new followers, with Instagram leading the engagement\nThis campaign reminded us that relatability and relevance are key to accessibility. When we blend science with humor, creativity, and a bit of corazón, we open doors to new audiences—and build lasting connections along the way.\n\n:::"

    "text": "Skywatching is inherently communal — people love to share awe-inspiring celestial moments, and a lunar eclipse presents the perfect opportunity to turn that shared wonder into engagement.\nTen days before the eclipse, we launched a coordinated campaign encouraging audiences to invite others to watch the event. By building anticipation early and layering in reminders, Stories, and carousels, we kept our audience engaged throughout. Once we identified momentum, we released a short-form video explainer that broke down what a lunar eclipse is — tapping into rising search interest just ahead of the big night.\nThe results:\n• 10 multimedia posts across Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and X\n• 3M+ users reached\n• 170,000 + total interactions\n• 24,000 + new followers, making it one of our most effective follow-driving efforts\n• Highest engagement came from Instagram, with a carousel achieving a 15% engagement rate\nMost reach came from Facebook, showcasing the importance of platform-specific strategy. On Facebook, the approach was to share location and times, in the form of sharable images.\nThis campaign demonstrated how timing, relevance, and audience-first storytelling can turn a natural event into a powerful opportunity for education and community-building. By releasing the explainer the day before the eclipse, we maximized both SEO value and audience curiosity at the exact moment they were looking for answers.\n\n:::"

    "text": "For NASA en Español, accessibility in science communication isn’t just about language—it’s about format, delivery, and creating moments that help people feel part of something bigger. When it came time to share key findings from the OSIRIS-REx mission to Asteroid Bennu, we knew we had to go beyond just a press release.\nWe launched a multimedia mini-campaign designed to break down the mission’s results across formats and platforms where our audience is most active. Across Instagram, X, Facebook, and YouTube, we published 11 posts ranging from short-form videos, GIFs, and images to repurposed interviews and Stories.\nThe results:\n• Over 300,000 users reached\n• Instagram led the way, with a single reel reaching 100,00 users\nContent included both media interviews and re-edited expert commentary, giving us reusable material for future storytelling efforts\nThis campaign served as a model for how we can translate complex science into digital-first formats, tapping into the curiosity of the public through visuals, voice, and cross-platform storytelling. By rethinking how we package mission updates, we’re making space exploration feel personal, understandable, and shareable.\n\n:::"
