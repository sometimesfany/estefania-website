Skywatching is inherently communal — people love to share awe-inspiring celestial moments, and a lunar eclipse presents the perfect opportunity to turn that shared wonder into engagement.

Ten days before the eclipse, we launched a coordinated campaign encouraging audiences to invite others to watch the event. By building anticipation early and layering in reminders, Stories, and carousels, we kept our audience engaged throughout. Once we identified momentum, we released a short-form video explainer that broke down what a lunar eclipse is — tapping into rising search interest just ahead of the big night.

The results:

• 10 multimedia posts across Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and X

• 3M+ users reached

• 170,000 + total interactions

• 24,000 + new followers, making it one of our most effective follow-driving efforts

• Highest engagement came from Instagram, with a carousel achieving a 15% engagement rate

Most reach came from Facebook, showcasing the importance of platform-specific strategy. On Facebook, the approach was to share location and times, in the form of sharable images.

This campaign demonstrated how timing, relevance, and audience-first storytelling can turn a natural event into a powerful opportunity for education and community-building. By releasing the explainer the day before the eclipse, we maximized both SEO value and audience curiosity at the exact moment they were looking for answers.
