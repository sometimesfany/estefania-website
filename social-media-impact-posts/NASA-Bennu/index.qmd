For NASA en Español, accessibility in science communication isn’t just about language—it’s about format, delivery, and creating moments that help people feel part of something bigger. When it came time to share key findings from the OSIRIS-REx mission to Asteroid Bennu, we knew we had to go beyond just a press release.

We launched a multimedia mini-campaign designed to break down the mission’s results across formats and platforms where our audience is most active. Across Instagram, X, Facebook, and YouTube, we published 11 posts ranging from short-form videos, GIFs, and images to repurposed interviews and Stories.

This collaboration included astrochemist Dr. José Aponte to translate technical discoveries into public-friendly messaging. Working closely with NASA’s Spanish-language public affairs lead and video producer —who managed live media interviews I ensured our content was consistent across all formats.

I tailored the talking points for social platforms, edited, and fact-checked a vertical video explainer for vertical platforms. A shorter version of the video was also created for Stories, summarizing key findings and linking to NASA’s science site for deeper learning.

The results:

• Over 400,000 users reached

• Instagram led the way, with a single reel reaching over 100,00 users


This campaign served as a model for how we can translate complex science into digital-first formats, tapping into the curiosity of the public through visuals, voice, and cross-platform storytelling. By rethinking how we package mission updates, we’re making space exploration feel personal, understandable, and shareable.
