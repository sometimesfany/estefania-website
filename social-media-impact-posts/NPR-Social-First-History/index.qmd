## Recuerdos: A project in collaboration with NPROye x Smithsonian National Museum of American History

### Overview

As part of a series I developed for NPROye—NPR's Latino social-first platform— and co-produced “Recuerdos” (“Memories”), a digital series highlighting underrepresented stories and contributions of U.S. Latinos. The project was a collaboration with the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.

### My Role

I led the research, reporting, interviews, and editorial direction for the series. While my production partner was based in Los Angeles, I conducted in-person interviews in Washington, D.C., often staying to speak with curators about artifacts that were not on public display. These conversations helped surface stories that were both visually rich and socially meaningful.

### Case Highlight 1: Celia Cruz on the Quarter
In 2024, Celia Cruz became the first Afro-Latina to appear on a U.S. quarter. The coin depicts her in one of her iconic bata cubanas (Cuban Rumba dresses), famously worn during her 1989 performance with La Sonora Matancera at Carnegie Hall—a landmark moment in her career.

To mark this milestone, we produced a video exploring Celia’s timeless style, her larger-than-life personality, and her influence on generations of Afro-Latino performers. The piece connected Cruz’s fashion to her broader cultural legacy—empowering the intersection of Blackness and Latinidad.

The video served both as an introduction for younger viewers discovering her for the first time and a nostalgic tribute for audiences who grew up with her music. It celebrated her Afro-Caribbean roots and the way her artistry continues to shape identity and representation in Latin music and culture.

### Case Highlight 2: El Paño

One standout piece focused on a hand-drawn handkerchief known as a paño—a powerful symbol of Chicano prison art. I discovered the artifact while exploring off-exhibit collections and wanted to contextualize its meaning beyond museum commentary. To give the piece authenticity and depth, I invited Martín García, a manager at The Marshall Project and a formerly incarcerated advocate, to speak on the prison economy and cultural significance of paños. His lived experience added critical perspective and emotional resonance.

The video was well received by our target audience—primarily Latinos aged 23–35—who engaged deeply with the content on Instagram and TikTok. By combining historical objects with personal narratives, Recuerdos offered a more inclusive lens into American history.

### Why It Matters
Recuerdos exemplifies my approach to social-first journalism: combining archival research, community voices, and thoughtful visual storytelling to reframe the narratives we share and preserve. Through emotion-driven, culturally grounded storytelling, we invite broader audiences to engage with U.S. history in ways that feel personal, accessible, and unforgettable.
